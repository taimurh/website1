      <description>In bioinformatics, k-mers refer to all the possible subsequences (of length k) from a read obtained through DNA sequencing. For example, if the DNA sequencing read is “ATCATCATG”, then a the 3-mers in that read include “ATC” (which occurs twice), “TCA” (which occurs twice), “CAT” (occurs twice), and “ATG” (occurs once). You can read more about k-mers on Wikipedia.
Write a function that takes a string of nucleotides as input and returns a dictionary with all 3-mers present in that string, and the number of times that each 3-mer occurs.</description>

      <description>INTRODUCTION  The two datasets chosen are MathAchieve and MathAchSchool. Both relate Achievement Scores in Mathematics to different variables which have been the focus of study for many articles in the modern world. MathAchieve contains the School number, status of being a Minority, Sex of the individual, Socioeconomic Status (SES), a numeric vector of mathematics achievement score (MathAch), and a numeric vector of the mean SES for the entire school.</description>
