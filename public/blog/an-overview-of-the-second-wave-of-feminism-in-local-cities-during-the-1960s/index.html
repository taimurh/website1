              <p>Feminism has been a major concern specifically for the American populace long before the advent of the civil rights movement. In early America, women tended to follow stereotypical roles and were seen as secondary to men. If any of them followed to increase their status by means of seeking profession or breaking the traditional gender stereotype, she would be shunned by the male-dominant society. A second-wave of feministic activism began in the 1960s and early 1970s causing a proliferation of feminist organizations across small cities, which inadvertently sought support from those in the larger metropolis in the area. In her article, “A Dynamic Force in Our Community,” Melissa Estes Blair discusses how the feminist movement in the smaller cities, such as that of Durham, differed from and channeled the feminist cause to that of the larger, as the larger cities were where primarily the movement was coordinated and the stage was set.</p>
<p>Women’s clubs became of utmost importance as key role players in spreading ideas of feminism away from larger cities into smaller cities. This seeping of sometimes radical ideas caused the beginning of the second wave of feminism. Explaining the importance of women’s clubs, Blair writes, “They enabled those conversations to take place within organizations committed to action. When the women’s movement began sweeping the nation, therefore, these organizations were primed to be receptive to its ideas and calls for action.”1 Women’s clubs became central to the community at large once they allowed women to vent their frustration regarding the system that prevented them from reaching their full potential. This overwhelming frustration will engender women’s desires to get more politically involved and, in some cases, take political action if need be. The inception of women’s clubs, and the subsequent discussions about daily problems, became crucial to gather support and ignite passions in women living away from the larger cities when the feminist movement picked its momentum in the 1970s.</p>
<p>The initiation of the Young Women’s Christian Association (YWCA) to include involvement disregarding race and color in local chapters helped foster the feminist cause. Blair explains the YWCA’s agenda as, “A large amount of the group’s time, particularly among the national leadership, became dedicated to fighting racism and racial discrimination. At the grassroots, struggles over integrating local chapters and combating discrimination were major parts of the YW’s agenda.”2 This integration exponentially increased the power of the feminist movement as the rapid increase in volunteers allowed for the creation of the YW-wives program and other services. Women discussed everything from fashion to foreign policy issues, and African American women had a bigger voice than ever before. The preponderance of women of both races and an understanding of their position in society pushed the members of the YWCA to put forth a national convention. Blair quotes,</p>
<p>“The YWCA has a new awareness of the significance of its own responsibilities as a women’s movement. It is faced with a new urgency to help women and girls find meaning in their own lives, develop to the full their capacity for leadership, [and] play an effective and constructive part in the life of today.”3</p>
<p>This declaration catapulted the feminist movement to unfathomable heights and gathered all women despite their social status, color, race or residential location in smaller or larger cities to a single cause – the betterment of women all around America.</p>
<p>With a particular focus on Durham, Blair describes the importance of the local League of Women Voters (LWV) in uplifting women’s spirits and providing information about current affairs across local lines. Blair writes about the role of the League by stating, “League officers and newsletter contributors often highlighted the role their organization could play in combating the supposed malaise in middle-class women’s lives, by keeping them engaged in current affairs and providing intellectually stimulating programs and meetings.”4 This supposed malaise which affected middle-class suburban housewives the most, who felt uneasy with their lives and wanted to live life on an equal footing as men, where they are allowed to choose when to marry or bear children, grew substantially and became a great concern. By providing programs that would inform women affected by the malaise, the League hoped to combat idleness and provide opportunities for activism and political involvement. Also, while there was significant upsurge in the number of housewives in the League, it is noteworthy to mention those professional women who also worked for the League. This diversity was essential as it recognized the diversity of the members of the League and women in America in general. Going forward, political leaders will have to include both sets of women in their public speeches to gain political support.</p>
<p>While the organizations of the larger cities sparked interest and debate over major decisions, it was primarily the role of the splinter organizations of the smaller cities to rally support and implement on those decisions. Concerning the YWs influence on the feminist movement, Blair writes, “Though the national headquarters called on YWs around the country to “revolutionize” society’s ideas about women, the Durham YW’s embrace of feminism was its own decision. It was not simply a case of a local chapter following the orders of the national board. Each YW chapter implemented the various national platform issues in its own way, and was free to prioritize those platform planks however the chapter saw fit.”5 Thus, if the local YW followed the national YW, it was only out of real passion and under strong local leadership. The financial drive to support the local YWCA and implementation on decisions regarding active participation came from inherent class fees and self-support by members from within. This ability of local feminist groups to standalone in the midst of the larger metropolitan YWCA and other smaller citywide organizations was crucial to the success of the second wave feminist movement as each organization was able to slightly tailor the main agenda to its own benefit resulting in an increase in subscription to these organizations.</p>
<p>The rise of the YWCA and other organizations was typically a result of women’s understanding of their predisposed status. Eric Foner in his book, “Give me Liberty,” writes about the plague of inequality and sexual exploitation that affected women while describing women’s stark realization as being secondary or insubordinate to men. “By 1967, women throughout the country were establishing “consciousness-raising” groups to discuss the sources of their discontent. The new feminism burst onto the national scene at the Miss America beauty pageant of 1968, when protestors filled a “freedom trash can” with objects of “oppression” – girdles, brassieres, high-heeled shoes, and copies of Playboy and Cosmopolitan.”6 These local consciousness groups that Foner depicts are described by Blair as well and aim to thwart the traditional idea of male-dominance. The protests by women will eventually be part of the women’s liberation movement, a by-product of the much broader feminist movement that propagated throughout America. When these smaller consciousness-raising groups, such as that mentioned by Blair as local YWCA’s, unite, they will have the potential and womanpower to emancipate women from traditional gender norms.</p>
<p>With the roaring second wave of feminism surging locally and nationally, Congress had to give in. The lawmakers understood that women, housewives and professionals alike, who lived in smaller or larger cities, demanded a set of constitutional rights. Foner describes the satisfactory reaction of the lawmakers to the feminist movement:
“In 1963, Congress passed the Equal Pay Act, barring sex discrimination among holders of the same jobs. The Civil Rights Act of 1964, as noted earlier, prohibited inequalities based on sex as well as race. Deluged by complaints of discrimination by working women, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission established by the law became a major force in breaking down barriers to female employment.”7
This seemed a major win in the eyes of many women; yet, rightfully so, the feminist movement did not subside. The smaller local organizations built out of decades of hard work and perseverance of women seemed to finally bear fruit with the introduction of new constitutional rights.</p>
<p>While Blair describes the smaller local organizations as essential to the second wave of feminism and perhaps, more important than the national organizations, factual data might suggest otherwise. Although Congress initiated the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA), there were still significant disparities which only the national organizations could properly address. The creation of the National Organization of Women (NOW) allowed for a massive platform which the smaller organizations failed to provide. Eric Foner, in his book “Voices of Freedom,” quotes the brochure of the Philadelphia Chapter of NOW released after the ERA explaining, “Unemployment is twice as high for women as for men. There are over 1,795 laws which discriminate against women.”8 This ability to openly criticize the actions of lawmakers was only possible in the case of large national organizations which could communicate more directly with the Congress. While Blair correctly identifies smaller organizations as important to the second wave of feminism, Foner directly discusses the tremendous effect and influence of the larger national organizations. More accurately, it can be deduced that these smaller local organizations were splinters and the larger national ones were bigger logs that enkindled the second wave of feminism across America.</p>
<p>Blair’s thesis is vital as it brings the context of the feminism uproar in the 1960s to smaller local organizations, instead of the more common approach historians use of solely describing the larger national ones. The thesis Blair proposes is fundamental to the core of American history as it gives insight into the nature of the changing women’s role from a homemaker, child-bearer, and a dependent on a man to a politically involved, well-aware, autonomous and modern woman. Throughout American history, from equal voting allowed by the 19th Amendment in 1919 to the Equal Rights Amendment, women have worked and protested for basic constitutional rights which they duly deserve. It is remarkable that American society has come a long way from inequality and sexual disparity to partially complete sexual equality. In today’s time, women continue to get involve in smaller local organizations and national ones as they continue to face nuances of sexual exploitation or inequality in their daily lives giving them a sense of insubordination to men. In my humble opinion, for complete and absolute equality to occur, men must change their mindset and see women on an equal footing.</p>
