              <p>Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy presents itself in adolescence, affecting the person’s well-being (Striano &amp; Nobile, 2018). It presents itself in myoclonic jerks causing the production of electrical spikes on a polygraph seen in Electroencephalogram tests (EEG) (de Nijs et al., 2012). Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy accounts for the most prevalent form of an idiopathic disease, where many doctors are completely oblivious to the actual cause of the seizures. Nonetheless, postmortem analysis reveals novel discoveries in the brain. More importantly, it shows that the brain affected by Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy has an abnormal cortex (de Nijs et al., 2009). The genetic component of the disease is multifaceted and intricate, where twenty-two chromosomal loci and seven genes have been pinpointed as responsible for causing the expression of the disease (Striano &amp; Nobile, 2018). The most noteworthy gene is the EFHC1 gene, coding a protein product involved in cell division and having a Ca2+- binding domain with a single EF-hand motif (de Nijs et al, 2009). The EFHC1 gene product is responsible for creating a proper cerebral cortex (complete corticogenesis, the formation of the cerebral cortex during development), with precise movement of neurons to their locations and micro-tubule movement during cell division. The cerebral cortex helps organisms in understanding and perceiving the world while microtubules are essential for the process of cell division pulling the condensed chromosomes to the poles of the cells. The mutations on the EFHC1 gene can be any of the missense, nonsense, or deletion frameshift mutations. Yet, the most commonly found in the EFHC1 gene are the missense mutations, which are a type of nonsynonymous mutations, with a single nucleotide changing to another causing an amino acid substitution (de Nijs et al., 2009). A primary focus on the effects of missense mutations in the gene EFHC1 causing disruptions in mitotic spindle organization, radial migration, corticogenesis and the locomotion of neurons is to be applied leading to a better understanding of juvenile myoclonic epilepsy.</p>
<p>The genetic undertone of juvenile myoclonic epilepsy is concerning to the medical community. The EFHC1 gene is important in proper brain development and is a primary cause of juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. EFHC1 is located on chromosome 6p12, where Intestinal cell kinase (ICK), another gene involved in juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, inhabits. One study describes how the investigators sequenced exomes of four affected individuals and 2 healthy individuals from the same family. It was found by Sanger Sequencing Data that all affected individuals, with epilepsy or EEG abnormalities, have mutations in the ICK gene or the EFHC1 gene. ICK mutations can show impaired mitosis, cell-cycle exit, and promotion of cell death via apoptosis, with a dominant phenotypical effect impairing the radial migration (from the ventricle to the outside of the cortex) of progenitor cells, also known as undifferentiated cells, to the surface of the cortex. Quite similar to the ICK gene, the EFHC1 has similar effects on the gray matter of a brain, such as impairment of the radial migration of progenitor cells (Striano &amp; Nobile, 2018). This relatively recent research has brought attention to the 6p12 region of the human genome, and further studies and prospective research by aspiring scientists can help enlighten more about the relationship between genetics and epilepsy.</p>
<p>While Striano &amp; Nobile (2018) informs that the EFHC1 gene itself is of significance, De Nijs et al. (2009) and De Nijs et al. (2012) propose that the different types of mutations that occur within it can have severe consequences. Missense mutations in the EFHC1 region are responsible for the most frequent cases of juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. De Nijs et al. (2009) and De Nijs et al. (2012) both explored and delineated the plethora of effects of the mutations in the EFHC1 gene. De Nijs et al. (2009) specifically desired to see the effects of EFHC1 gene on corticogenesis. The study used mouse and rabbits as models, and constructed plasmids for expression of eukaryotic genes, processed embryonic brains, and employed immunostaining procedures which had specific polyclonal antibodies to EFHC1 and GFP. Immunoprecipitation, western blotting and electroporation were also used. For all statistical analyses’ purposes, they used one-way ANOVA or t-tests. Results show that EFHC1 is a Mitogen Activated Protein (MAP), involved in mitotic spindle formation, and is essential for cell cycle of cortical progenitors. HEK293 (human embryonic kidney) cells were used where EFHC1 was tagged with EGFP. It showed that EFHC1 does indeed contact with alpha-tubulin and DNA during mitotic spindle organization. Without EFHC1, chromosome alignment is impaired, and chromosomes fail to align at the metaphase plate. The percent of abnormal spindles formed increased from 20% to around 75-95%, showing a statistically significant change. Furthermore, EFHC1 gene is important in radial migration of projection neurons in the development of a young brain. Electroporation on brain slices separated those with Red fluorescence proteins (progenitors) to those without (post-mitotic). The distribution of post-mitotic neurons was dampened when rEFHC1 shRNA (short hairpin RNA used to silence gene expression) was introduced which bind to EFHC1 mRNA (de Nijs et al., 2009). All the aforementioned information provides solid evidence that EFHC1 gene is responsible for effective communication, cell division, and maturation of the brain and any disruption in the coding region could cause the inception of juvenile myoclonic epilepsy.</p>
<p>Similar to De Nijs et al. (2009), De Nijs et al. (2012) aimed to find the effects of the heterozygous missense mutations in Myoclonin1/EFHC1 but with the clear intent to clarify the pathophysiology of juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. Point mutations, including D210N, R221H, F229L and D253Y, for tests were introduced in EFHC1 by the use of parent vectors and plasmids. Rats and Mice were the model organisms for the study. While De Nijs et al. (2009) used electroporation on brain slices, De Nijs et al. (2012) used electroporation in utero where five electrical pulses were discharged across the uterine wall after the mother was anesthetized. Dissection of embryonic brains was also attempted to find differences in cortical architecture. Immunostaining procedures, involving monoclonal antibodies, was used for staining and identification. All statistical analyses employed one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s post-hoc test. Results showed that juvenile myoclonic epilepsy indeed causes mitotic spindle defects and impairs the radial migration of projection neurons in the cerebral cortex. Each point mutation caused a statistically significant increase in production of abnormal spindles, from a mere 30% in EGFP-EFHC1 to 70% in D210N, 60 % in R221H, 70% in F229L and 75% in D253Y mutations. Contrary to expectations, it was found by in utero electroporation that EFHC1 mutants had no different rates of progenitor cell proliferation and cell cycle. All the point mutations introduced in the EFHC1 region affect the morphology of radial glia and migrating projection neurons, the neurons found in the central nervous system, while affecting migration of interneurons, the neurons connecting other neurons especially in a reflex arc. Focal electroporation was used to calculate the percentage of EFGP+ cells (with GFP tagged to EFHC1) in cortex which decreased statistically significantly from 35% in wild type to 12% with mutants, showing the decrease in interneuron migration with mutations in the EFHC1 gene (de Nijs et al., 2012). This study provides direct evidence that disruption in EFHC1 coding region can affect phenotypically and can plausibly cause juvenile myoclonic epilepsy.</p>
<p>While studies by de Nijs et al. (2009) and de Nijs et al. (2012) focus on the phenotypic result of mutations in the EFHC1 gene through different animal models, Jara-Prado et al. (2012) posits an on-going process of identifying mutations in the EFHC1 gene where it is favorable to investigate the presence of mutations in a specific ethnicity as it explains the disease through the lens of inheritance patterns in humans. Jara-Prado et al. (2012) identified R118C, R153Q and R182L as the newly discovered missense mutations in the EFHC1 gene on 6p12 in Mexican patients with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. By investigating the coding regions of EFHC1 in the blood of forty-one patients with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy at the National Institute of Neurology and Neurosurgery in Mexico City and 100 ordinary healthy individuals, and sequencing the DNA in an automated DNA sequencer after employing the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique, the results identified three new missense mutations, one of which changes a cysteine to an arginine. The second mutation substitutes lysine for arginine and the third changes arginine to glutamine. In silico analysis revealed that all three mutations occured in an evolutionary conserved sequence, the exon 3 of the EFHC1 gene (Jara-Prado et al., 2012). Coupled with the research by de Nijs et al. (2012), this study reveals the potential of finding new and different mutations in the EFHC1 region and how they cause the same phenotype of juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, such as abnormal cortex development and migratory behavior of neurons. It also signifies the importance of conserving an evolutionary conserved sequence, as any sort of mutation in a conserved sequence can have disastrous effects on an organism. The reason why a sequence is ‘evolutionary’ conserved is because it is crucial for the survivability or fitness of the organism.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, the role of EFHC1 gene in the expression of juvenile myoclonic epilepsy in brain development, including the assembly of mitotic spindle, radial migration, corticogenesis, and locomotion of projection and interneurons is profound. The articles by de Nijs et al. (2009) and de Nijs et al. (2012) highlight the intricacies that result from missense mutations in the EFHC1 gene. There is no doubt that EFHC1 has huge impact on the effective communication, cell division, and maturation of the brain, as it is responsible for proper migratory behavior of neurons (de Nijs et al., 2009) While EFHC1 mutations have no change in rate of progenitor cell proliferation and cell cycle exit, they have tremendous altering effects on the morphology of radial glia, migrating projection neurons and migrating interneurons. All the aforementioned data pinpoint to the conclusion that disruption in EFHC1 coding region can cause disruption in mitotic spindle organization, radial migration, corticogenesis, and the locomotion of neurons; therefore, mutations in the EFHC1 gene are primarily responsible for causing juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (de Nijs et al., 2012).  With this insight into the EFHC1 gene, it is worthwhile to note that the sheer abundance of undiscovered information in science, specifically genomics, suggest the vast possibilities outside of the EFHC1 gene – perhaps, the entire human genome, which if mutated could cause juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. As the research led by Jara Prado et al. (2012) suggests, there is an increasing possibility that mutations in evolutionary conserved sequences could cause the disease (Jara Prado et al., 2012). Exon 3 specifically of the EFHC1 gene seems to be a hotspot where there are several single nucleotide polymorphisms responsible for leading to the diseased phenotype. By continuing on this search of finding the many mutations, scientists perhaps can discover new techniques to diagnose this idiopathic disease by identifying early or using anti-epileptic treatments, and have a renewed posture and outlook towards Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy.</p>
