      <description>Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy presents itself in adolescence, affecting the person’s well-being (Striano &amp;amp; Nobile, 2018). It presents itself in myoclonic jerks causing the production of electrical spikes on a polygraph seen in Electroencephalogram tests (EEG) (de Nijs et al., 2012). Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy accounts for the most prevalent form of an idiopathic disease, where many doctors are completely oblivious to the actual cause of the seizures. Nonetheless, postmortem analysis reveals novel discoveries in the brain.</description>

      <description>In bioinformatics, k-mers refer to all the possible subsequences (of length k) from a read obtained through DNA sequencing. For example, if the DNA sequencing read is “ATCATCATG”, then a the 3-mers in that read include “ATC” (which occurs twice), “TCA” (which occurs twice), “CAT” (occurs twice), and “ATG” (occurs once). You can read more about k-mers on Wikipedia.
Here is a function that takes a string of nucleotides as input and returns a dictionary with all 3-mers present in that string, and the number of times that each 3-mer occurs.</description>
